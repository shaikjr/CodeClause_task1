# Spam Classifier Using Artificial Intelligence

![Spam Classifier](spam_classifier.png)

## Introduction

This repository contains a Spam Classifier built using Artificial Intelligence. The Spam Classifier is a machine learning model that can automatically classify emails or text messages as either spam or not spam (ham). It utilizes AI techniques, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), to make this classification.

## Features

- Automatically classifies text data as spam or not spam.
- Utilizes NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms.
- Easy-to-use interface for integration into your applications.

## Installation

To use the Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-classifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd spam-classifier
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download or prepare your dataset of text messages or emails for training and testing.

## Usage

You can use the Spam Classifier by importing it into your Python code and applying it to your text data. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```python
from spam_classifier import SpamClassifier

# Initialize the Spam Classifier
classifier = SpamClassifier()

# Load the trained model (you can train your own as well)
classifier.load_model('trained_model.pkl')

# Classify a text message
text_message = "Get rich quick! Click here to claim your prize."
result = classifier.classify(text_message)

if result == 'spam':
    print("This message is spam.")
else:
    print("This message is not spam.")
```

## Training

To train your own Spam Classifier, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your labeled dataset with examples of spam and non-spam messages.

2. Modify the configuration and parameters in the `train.py` script to suit your dataset and preferences.

3. Run the training script:

   ```shell
   python train.py
   ```

4. The trained model will be saved as a `.pkl` file, which you can then load for classification.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of your Spam Classifier using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can use test datasets with known labels to assess how well your model is performing.
